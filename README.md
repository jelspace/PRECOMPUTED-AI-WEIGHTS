# PRECOMPUTED-AI-WEIGHTS
PRECOMPUTED AI WEIGHTS,INSTANT RESULT!!!!!!!!!!

BY (1D,2D,3D,..?)CHUNKS THEN KAN OR DIRECT(VERY SMALL MODELS) , 
ALL Q4 POSSIBILITIES/COMBINATIONS  ARE 100TB FOR EXAMPLE FOR 10B 20B MODEL (DATABASE SIZE MAY WRONG COMPUTED 100TB  WITH PRECOMPUTED WIEGHTS)

NOT TESTED JUST IDEA


ESTIMATED SPEED IN QUAD CORE CPU 2Mt/s(TWO MILLION TOKENS PER SECOND) VS OLD COMPUTING 1t/s

WHICH IS 2 MILLION TIMES FASTER(MAY NOT SO FAST IF ONLY MULTIPLICATION IS PRECOMPUTED)

BENEFITS :ZERO POWER CONSUMPTION (COMPARED WITH OLD COMPUTE TECHNOLOGY)

ULTRA FAST ALL VISION STT TTS MODELS INCLUDE REAL TIME AND UP DIFFUSION VIDEO GANERATION,SIMULATORS

LATEST NEWS:
PRECOMPUTING ALL POSSIBILITIES/COMBINATIONS BY LAYERS INTO ADDRESSABLE BY IN DATA DATABASE ALSO SEEMS POSSIBLE

************************************************************************************************
IDEA IS TO PRECOMPUTE ONLY MULTIPLICATION AND STORE RESULTS IN DATABASE,FOR ALL POSSIBLE INPUTS
************************************************************************************************

SIZE EXPANDING IS Q4 = X 16
IF MODEL IS 16GB IN SIZE Q4 THEN WITH PRECOMPUTED MULTIPLICATION WILL BE 256GB


NOT TESTED AND NOT FULLY FINISHED
